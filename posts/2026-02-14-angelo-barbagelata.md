Angelo Barbagelata was born in Novi Ligure, in the province of Alessandria, in 1875. He earned his *laurea* in Electrical Engineering in 1898 and went to work at the National Electrotechnical Workshops of Eng. Monti in Pavia. By 1899 he was a volunteer assistant to Prof. Zunini at the IEICE Laboratory. In 1910 he qualified as *libero docente* in Electrical Measurements.

He belonged to the second generation of Italian electrical engineers, the generation after Galileo Ferraris. He played a decisive role in the development of modern electric traction and made fundamental contributions to AC measurement. Most of the electrical installations in Northern Italy passed through his hands as designer and tester. From 1916 to 1925 he served as technical consultant to Società Breda, designing and testing power station machinery across the north of the country.

At the Politecnico di Milano, he rose through the chairs: professor of Electrical Machines in 1914, extraordinary professor of Electrical Machine Construction in 1923, ordinary professor of Electrical Technologies and then Electrical Systems in 1926. From 1931 to 1948 he taught Electrical Measurements and directed the Carlo Erba Institution at the Politecnico. In 1950 he became Professor Emeritus. He also taught at ITIS Feltrinelli in Milan and directed the Politecnico's School for Welding Workers.

He published eighty articles and five books: *Le applicazioni industriali dell'Elettrotecnica* (1912, revised 1918), *Macchine Elettriche* in two parts (1922, revised 1944), *Metodi fondamentali per le misure industriali* (1930), *Misure Elettriche* in two volumes (1950), and *Macchine ed apparecchi Elettrici* (1955). His articles, considered crucial at the time of publication, remain methodological references.

He was chief editor and then director of the journal *L'Elettrotecnica*. He served as secretary of the Milan section of AEI (Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana) from 1916 to 1918, and from 1931 until his death he was National Secretary of AEI. He was a member of the Superior Council of Public Works, the National Council of Research, the Lombard Institute, and the Accademia dei XL. He served as honorary vice president of CIGRE and as president of the CGS measurement instruments committee. After the Second World War he was president of the Italian Electrotechnical Committee. He was awarded the Jona Prize in 1922 and the Colombo Prize in 1930. In 1932, the International Congress in Paris commissioned him to draw up the General Report on AC Measurements.

A colleague, Prof. Danusso, described him as a scientist "who at every moment hid himself in humility, who cared only about true values, who set things right with upright judgment, respectful to all." He always wrote to make things known, never to make himself known. In 1908, four years after building a piece of apparatus, he finally published the theory behind it — only because he learned that others were trying to copy it and deny him credit. 
He believed the university should adapt itself to the average student, and he contributed to reforming university regulations along those lines.

Among his students was [Ercole Bottani](/blog/2026-02-06-ercole-bottani), who graduated under him with top honors — 110 out of 110, *con lode* — and went on to build the first electronic computing center in Europe at the Politecnico. From Bottani the line runs to [Luigi Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda), to [Domenico Ferrari](/blog/2026-02-14-domenico-ferrari), to [Jehan-François Pâris](/blog/2026-02-14-jehan-francois-paris), and to me.

Angelo Barbagelata died in Milan on May 23, 1960. On the desk of his engineering studio at via San Paolo 10, his calendar still showed his last appointment: "13 maggio 1960: perizia." He had told friends he was worried about that job. Below the entry, to give himself courage, he had written: "The life of each of us is a militia, and moreover a long and varied one. You must observe your duty as a soldier and carry out everything at the commander's signal, if possible divining what he wants." He was eighty-five years old and still working.
