# My Academic Ancestors

*Ercole Bottani (1897–1978)*

My academic lineage does not lead to Göttingen or Basel. It does not climb neatly to Gauss or the Bernoullis. It begins, solidly and without mythology, in Milan, with Ercole Bottani (1897–1978).

Bottani was not a celestial mechanician or a theorist of abstract analysis. He was an electrical engineer at the moment when electrical engineering was becoming a rigorous science. Trained at the Politecnico di Milano in the years after the First World War, he entered a discipline still balancing craft knowledge and mathematical formalism. He helped push it decisively toward formalism.

He held the chair in electrical measurements, and that detail matters. Measurement is where abstraction is forced to answer to reality. Circuits, fields, and networks were not merely hardware to him; they were mathematical objects whose behavior could be modeled, reasoned about, and disciplined. His work lived in that junction between physical infrastructure and formal structure.

After the Second World War, as Northern Italy rebuilt its electrical grid, Bottani served as Commissioner for Electricity in Upper Italy from 1945 to 1950. He worked at the scale of systems: grids, industrial supply, coordination. In 1955, he helped found the Centro Calcoli Numerici at the Politecnico di Milano—the first electronic computing center in Europe open to industry. The following year, he established CESI (Centro Elettrotecnico Sperimentale Italiano), the national laboratory for electrical testing and experimentation. The trajectory from electrical measurement to digital computation is not accidental. It marks a generational pivot: from controlling current to controlling information.

The academic line runs from Ercole Bottani to Luigi Dadda, pioneer of digital electronics and computer engineering; from Luigi Dadda to Domenico Ferrari; from Domenico Ferrari to Jehan-François Pâris; and from Jehan-François Pâris to me.

It is not a lineage of pure mathematicians refining theorem chains in abstraction. It is a lineage of engineers and systems thinkers—people who believed that mathematics belongs inside machines, networks, and infrastructures. The formalism is there, but it is always in contact with implementation.

My academic ancestry stops with Ercole Bottani. But stopping there feels less like a deficit than a grounding. He belonged to the generation that built the technical substrate—measurement standards, power systems, early computing centers—on which later theoretical elegance depends.

Since Italy did not grant doctorates according to the same model, there is an argument for my ancestry extending further back to Angelo Barbagelata (Novi Ligure, September 14, 1875 – Milan, May 23, 1960), the teacher of Ercole Bottani. Barbagelata was an Italian electrical engineer who, after the Second World War, served as president of the Italian Electrotechnical Committee. From 1931 to 1948 he was Director of the Carlo Erba Institution at the Politecnico di Milano. He was a member of the Superior Council of Public Works, the National Council of Research, the Lombard Institute, and the Accademia dei XL. He was also honorary vice president of CIGRE and president of the C.G.S. measurement instruments committee. Barbagelata was awarded the Jona Prize (1922) and the Columbus Prize (1930). In 1932, the International Congress in Paris commissioned him to draw up the General Report on AC Measurements.

Academic genealogy is often treated as prestige archaeology. For me, it is closer to inheritance of temperament: rigor tied to implementation, abstraction tied to systems, theory that must ultimately work.
