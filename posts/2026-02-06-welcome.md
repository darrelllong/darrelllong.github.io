*Ercole Bottani (1897–1978)*

My academic lineage begins in Milan, with Ercole Bottani (1897–1978). No Gauss, no Bernoullis. Engineers, all the way up.

Bottani was born in Volpago del Montello, in the province of Treviso. He studied at the Politecnico di Milano after the First World War, graduating with 110 cum laude in General Electrical Engineering under Angelo Barbagelata. He entered a discipline still balancing craft knowledge and mathematical formalism, and he pushed it toward formalism. He held the chair in electrical measurements — the part of the field where your models have to actually match what the instruments say. Circuits, fields, and networks were mathematical objects to him, but they had to work.

He was tall, eccentric, and wore reinforced boots with iron heels. Students heard him coming before they saw him — the clattering on the wooden floors of Politecnico preceded him into every classroom.

## Rebuilding and Building

After the Second World War, as Northern Italy rebuilt its electrical grid, Bottani served as Commissioner for Electricity in Upper Italy from 1945 to 1950. This was serious work — coordinating the restoration of power to a shattered industrial region. He operated at the scale of systems: grids, industrial supply, coordination across provinces.

In 1955, he helped found the Centro Calcoli Numerici at the Politecnico di Milano — the first electronic computing center in Europe open to industry. The following year, he established CESI (Centro Elettrotecnico Sperimentale Italiano), the national laboratory for electrical testing and experimentation. That same year, 1956, he became chairman of MM SpA, the company created to finance and build the Milan Metro. He resigned the chairmanship in 1962 over political conflicts, which sounds about right for a man who preferred engineering problems to political ones.

The move from electrical measurement to digital computation was a natural one for him. If you spend your career insisting that engineering be quantitative and rigorous, eventually you need machines that can do the arithmetic.

Bottani also co-authored teaching material with his young colleague [Luigi Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda), crediting him as collaborator — an unusual gesture that says something about how Bottani treated the people around him. When it came time to bring a digital computer to Italy, it was Bottani's institutional clout, together with Rector Gino Cassinis, that made it happen. Dadda did the technical work of getting the CRC 102A from San Diego to Milan, but Bottani made sure the university backed the project.

## The Italian Laurea and Academic Lineage

When I say my academic ancestry "stops" with Bottani, I should explain why. The concept of a doctoral advisor, so central to academic genealogy in the American and German traditions, did not really exist in Italy for most of the twentieth century.

Italy's traditional university degree was the *laurea*, a four- or five-year course of study culminating in a thesis and an oral examination before a faculty commission. It was rigorous — roughly equivalent to what Americans would call a master's degree — but it was the terminal degree. There was no separate doctorate. When Enrico Fermi graduated from the University of Pisa in 1922, he received a *laurea*. When Bottani graduated from Politecnico, he received a *laurea*. When Dadda graduated in 1947, same thing. The *laurea* was what Italian universities granted, period.

Italy did not introduce the *dottorato di ricerca* — a research doctorate comparable to the Ph.D. — until 1980, and it took years for the system to mature. Before then, the path to an academic career ran through the *laurea*, followed by positions as an assistant under a senior professor, then the *libera docenza* (a qualification to teach independently), and eventually competition for a professorial chair. The relationships between senior professors and their assistants were real mentorships, often lasting decades, but they were not formalized in the way that a doctoral advisor-student relationship is in the American system.

The Bologna Process of 1999 eventually standardized European higher education into the three-cycle bachelor's/master's/doctorate structure we know today. But for the generations of Italian academics before that — Barbagelata, Bottani, Dadda, and even Ferrari (who earned his *Dottore in Ingegneria* in 1963, a *laurea*-level degree despite the title) — the academic lineage is traced through mentorship and collaboration, through who worked under whom and who shaped whose thinking. The Mathematics Genealogy Project does its best with this, but it is mapping a German and American framework onto a system that worked differently.

This is why my lineage stops where it stops. Bottani's teacher was Angelo Barbagelata, but the relationship was that of professor and student in a *laurea* program, not advisor and doctoral candidate. The line is real, but the formalism thins out.

## The Lineage

The academic line runs from Ercole Bottani to [Luigi Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda), pioneer of digital electronics and computer engineering; from Dadda to [Domenico Ferrari](/blog/2026-02-14-domenico-ferrari); from Ferrari to Jehan-François Pâris; and from Pâris to me.

Bottani belonged to the generation that built the technical substrate — measurement standards, power systems, early computing centers — that made everything after it possible. I am fine with starting there.

## Barbagelata

There is an argument for my ancestry extending further back to Angelo Barbagelata (1875–1960), the teacher of Ercole Bottani. Barbagelata was an Italian electrical engineer who, after the Second World War, served as president of the Italian Electrotechnical Committee. From 1931 to 1948 he was Director of the Carlo Erba Institution at the Politecnico di Milano. He was a member of the Superior Council of Public Works, the National Council of Research, the Lombard Institute, and the Accademia dei XL. He was also honorary vice president of CIGRE and president of the C.G.S. measurement instruments committee. Barbagelata was awarded the Jona Prize (1922) and the Columbus Prize (1930). In 1932, the International Congress in Paris commissioned him to draw up the General Report on AC Measurements.
