*Ercole Bottani (1897–1978)*

My academic lineage begins in Milan, with Ercole Bottani (1897–1978). No Gauss, no Bernoullis. Engineers, all the way up.

Bottani was an electrical engineer, trained at the Politecnico di Milano in the years after the First World War. He entered a discipline still balancing craft knowledge and mathematical formalism, and he pushed it toward formalism. He held the chair in electrical measurements — the part of the field where your models have to actually match what the instruments say. Circuits, fields, and networks were mathematical objects to him, but they had to work.

After the Second World War, as Northern Italy rebuilt its electrical grid, Bottani served as Commissioner for Electricity in Upper Italy from 1945 to 1950. He worked at the scale of systems: grids, industrial supply, coordination. In 1955, he helped found the Centro Calcoli Numerici at the Politecnico di Milano — the first electronic computing center in Europe open to industry. The following year, he established CESI (Centro Elettrotecnico Sperimentale Italiano), the national laboratory for electrical testing and experimentation. The move from electrical measurement to digital computation was a natural one for him.

The academic line runs from Ercole Bottani to [Luigi Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda), pioneer of digital electronics and computer engineering; from Dadda to [Domenico Ferrari](/blog/2026-02-14-domenico-ferrari); from Ferrari to Jehan-François Pâris; and from Pâris to me.

My academic ancestry stops with Bottani. I am fine with that. He belonged to the generation that built the technical substrate — measurement standards, power systems, early computing centers — that made everything after it possible.

Since Italy did not grant doctorates according to the same model, there is an argument for my ancestry extending further back to Angelo Barbagelata (1875–1960), the teacher of Ercole Bottani. Barbagelata was an Italian electrical engineer who, after the Second World War, served as president of the Italian Electrotechnical Committee. From 1931 to 1948 he was Director of the Carlo Erba Institution at the Politecnico di Milano. He was a member of the Superior Council of Public Works, the National Council of Research, the Lombard Institute, and the Accademia dei XL. He was also honorary vice president of CIGRE and president of the C.G.S. measurement instruments committee. Barbagelata was awarded the Jona Prize (1922) and the Columbus Prize (1930). In 1932, the International Congress in Paris commissioned him to draw up the General Report on AC Measurements.
