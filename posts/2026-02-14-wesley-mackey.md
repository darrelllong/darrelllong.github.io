excerpt: "Thirty years of teaching compilers and languages at UCSC, a Latin email address, and a man who genuinely cared about his students."
---

Wesley Mackey earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba. He reportedly hated the cold, which may explain the rest of his career trajectory: first to Florida International University in the early 1980s, then to California. By the early 1990s he had landed at UC Santa Cruz, where he would stay for roughly thirty years.

He was a lecturer — not tenure-track faculty, not a researcher chasing grants. He taught. That was the job, and he took it seriously. Over three decades he handled the courses that every CS major had to get through: Fundamentals of Compiler Design, Comparative Programming Languages, Advanced Programming. His compilers sequence went back to at least 1995. One of his courses famously had students learning a new programming language every two weeks. If you went through the UCSC CS program between the 1990s and 2022, you almost certainly sat in a Mackey class.

## The Teacher

Mackey was a geek's geek. He loved programming, he loved languages, and he loved teaching people about both. His lecture notes were thorough and well-written. He was patient with questions and accessible outside of class. He kept using older languages and tools that some students found dated, but there was a reason: he was teaching fundamentals, and fundamentals don't expire. Not everyone appreciated this at the time. Some did later.

In 2007-08, UCSC gave him the Excellence in Teaching Award, a campus-wide honor based on student nominations. That tells you what the students thought of him, at least the ones who were paying attention.

He taught at UCSC for so long that he became something of a landmark. Students from different decades would compare notes and realize they'd all had the same experience — the same rigor, the same deep knowledge, the same willingness to help. "The man's just casually been a legend for 30+ years," one student wrote, which about sums it up.

## Fato Profugus

Mackey was a Latinist. He was genuinely interested in Roman history and could read Latin, which is not something you expect from a computer science lecturer. His email didn't come from a standard @ucsc.edu address — it came from fatoprofugus.soe.ucsc.edu. Students noticed and puzzled over it.

The phrase is from the second line of Virgil's *Aeneid*: *fato profugus*, "driven by fate" — Virgil's description of Aeneas, exile and wanderer, who left the ruins of Troy and eventually founded Rome. Whether Mackey saw himself as a fugitive of fate who had wandered from Manitoba to Miami to Santa Cruz, or whether he just liked the joke, I never asked. But it was entirely in character: a small, literate, private gesture that most people wouldn't catch.

He also had essentially no internet presence. No faculty webpage, no LinkedIn, no social media, no published photo that anyone could find. In a computer science department. Students on Reddit would ask if anyone had a picture of him, and nobody did. For a generation of students who couldn't imagine existing without a digital footprint, this made him genuinely mysterious.

## Code in C

Mackey shows up in the [Songs of our People](https://github.com/darrelllong/Songs-of-our-People), a collection of CS parodies of Beatles songs. In "Code in C" (to the tune of "Let It Be"), the lyric goes: "When my code has tons of trouble, Wesley Mackey comes to me, speaking words of wisdom: Code in C." It is probably the only computer science folk song to reference a UCSC lecturer, and he deserved it.

## Retirement

Mackey retired in 2022 after about twenty-nine years at UCSC. He did not make a big announcement. He just stopped being on the schedule. When someone posted the news on a student forum, the reply was: "End of an era." That was about right.

I knew Wesley Mackey. He was a good man and a dedicated teacher, and the students were lucky to have him.
