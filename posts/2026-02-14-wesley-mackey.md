excerpt: "Thirty years of teaching compilers and languages at UCSC, a Latin email address, and a man who cared about his students."

Wesley Mackey earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba. He hated the cold, which may explain the rest of his career: first to Florida International University in the early 1980s, then to California. By the early 1990s he was at UC Santa Cruz, where he would stay for roughly thirty years as a lecturer in Computer Science.

Over three decades he taught the courses that every CS major had to get through: Fundamentals of Compiler Design, Comparative Programming Languages, Advanced Programming. His compilers sequence went back to at least 1995. One of his courses had students learning a new programming language every two weeks. If you went through the UCSC CS program between the 1990s and 2022, you almost certainly sat in a Mackey class.

He loved programming, he loved languages, and he loved teaching people about both. His lecture notes were thorough and well-written. He was patient with questions and accessible outside of class. He kept using older languages and tools that some students found dated, but he was teaching fundamentals. In 2007-08, UCSC gave him the Excellence in Teaching Award, a campus-wide honor based on student nominations. Students from different decades would compare notes and realize they'd all had the same experience — the rigor, the knowledge, the willingness to help. "The man's just casually been a legend for 30+ years," one student wrote.

Mackey was also a Latinist, genuinely interested in Roman history, which is not something you run into much in a CS department. His email came from fatoprofugus.soe.ucsc.edu rather than a standard @ucsc.edu address. Students noticed and puzzled over it. The phrase is from the second line of Virgil's *Aeneid*: *fato profugus*, "driven by fate" — Virgil's description of Aeneas, who fled the ruins of Troy and wandered the Mediterranean until he reached Italy. A Canadian who fled the cold for Miami and then Santa Cruz could do worse for a motto.

He had essentially no internet presence — no faculty webpage, no LinkedIn, no social media, no published photo that anyone could find. Students on Reddit would ask if anyone had a picture of him, and nobody did.

Mackey shows up in the [Songs of our People](https://github.com/darrelllong/Songs-of-our-People), a collection of CS parodies of Beatles songs. In "Code in C" (to the tune of "Let It Be"), the lyric goes: "When my code has tons of trouble, Wesley Mackey comes to me, speaking words of wisdom: Code in C."

He retired in 2022 after about twenty-nine years at UCSC. When someone posted the news on a student forum, the reply was: "End of an era."

I knew Wesley Mackey. He was a good man who cared about his students, and they were lucky to have him.
