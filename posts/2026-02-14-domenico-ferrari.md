Domenico Ferrari came from Piacenza and earned his Dottore in Ingegneria Elettronica from the Politecnico di Milano in 1963, studying under [Luigi Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda). He stayed briefly as an assistant professor, then left for the United States. In 1970, he joined the faculty at UC Berkeley in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, where he would spend twenty-five years.

He became full professor, chaired the Computer Science Division from 1983 to 1987, and retired in 1995 as Professor Emeritus. He spent 1976–77 as a visiting professor back at Politecnico.

Ferrari's early work at Berkeley was in computer systems performance. He applied queueing theory and workload characterization to the measurement and modeling of time-sharing systems and virtual memory. His 1978 book *Computer Systems Performance Evaluation* became a standard reference. In 1984, he wrote a pointed technical report arguing that performance evaluation had developed too much in isolation and needed to be woven into mainstream computer architecture and software design. In 1987, he received the A.A. Michelson Award for outstanding contributions to computer metrics and was named an IEEE Fellow.

When Bob Fabry stepped aside from the Computer Systems Research Group in the mid-1980s, Ferrari and Susan Graham took over administration of CSRG and the development of Berkeley Unix. The BSD project released 4.3BSD under them, which refined the TCP/IP stack and the Berkeley Fast File System that had been introduced in 4.2BSD. The BSD releases became the standard research platform for networking and distributed computing, and the open dissemination of the code fed directly into FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NeXTSTEP, and eventually macOS. The Berkeley socket API and networking code from this period remain in use.

In 1989, Ferrari founded the Tenet Group at Berkeley and the International Computer Science Institute, focusing on quality-of-service guarantees for real-time multimedia over packet-switched networks. The Internet at that point was best-effort only. The group designed and built two real-time protocol suites, Tenet I and II, and showed that you could carry video and audio with strict timing guarantees over wide-area networks if you got the scheduling and admission control right. They published extensively on delay jitter control, traffic specification, admission control, and rate-controlled scheduling. Per-flow resource reservation, real-time transport protocols — much of this fed into later standards like Integrated Services and RSVP. Ferrari directed the Tenet Group until his retirement in 1995.

Ferrari supervised over three dozen Ph.D. students at Berkeley between the early 1970s and 2000. The Mathematics Genealogy Project lists them. His students went on to faculty positions at Bologna, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Rice, UC San Diego, Waterloo, and Berkeley itself, and to research labs at IBM and beyond.

One of those students was [Jehan-François Pâris](/blog/2026-02-14-jehan-francois-paris), who became my own doctoral advisor. The line runs from [Bottani](/blog/2026-02-06-ercole-bottani) to [Dadda](/blog/2026-02-14-luigi-dadda) to Ferrari to [Pâris](/blog/2026-02-14-jehan-francois-paris) to me — engineers and system builders, all the way down.

After retiring from Berkeley in 1995, Ferrari went home. He founded the Center for Research on the Applications of Telematics to Organizations and Society (CRATOS) at the Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Piacenza, applying networking research to telemedicine, e-government, and the emerging internet economy. In 2000, he was appointed Professore Ordinario per Chiara Fama — full professor "by clear renown" — in Computer Science, and he launched a Master's program in Management in the Network Economy.

Ferrari was named an IEEE Fellow in 1987 and an ACM Fellow in 2001. In 2006, he became the first Italian to receive the ACM SIGCOMM Award, one of the highest honors in computer networking. The citation recognized his contributions to Internet QoS architecture, his leadership of ICSI as a networking research center, his management of the Berkeley Unix project, and his mentorship of doctoral students.

He is my academic grandfather. I never studied with him directly, but his influence reached me through Pâris.
