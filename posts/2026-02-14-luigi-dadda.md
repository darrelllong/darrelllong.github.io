excerpt: "The father of Italian computer engineering, from analog circuits to the Dadda multiplier."
---

Luigi Dadda was born on April 29, 1923, in Lodi, Italy, into a family of farmers. Nothing in his origins predicted what he would become. But the drive was there early: during the Second World War, he bicycled fifty kilometers to retrieve textbooks after a Milan science bookstore was bombed. That is not mere dedication. That is a declaration of intent.

He enrolled in electrical engineering at the Politecnico di Milano and completed his *laurea* in 1947, with a thesis on signal transmission via a microwave radio link between Turin and Trieste. He stayed on immediately as an assistant professor, beginning what would become a half-century career at the institution. His mentor was [Ercole Bottani](/blog/2026-02-06-welcome), who shaped his practical, problem-centered approach to engineering.

## From Analog to Digital

Dadda's early research was in analog computing: electrical network models applied to physics and engineering problems, solving Laplace's equations for studying magnetic fields and other phenomena. He worked with Bottani at the National Research Council on developing these analog computing models, simulating large power networks and physical systems. The work was concrete and applied, in the spirit of Bottani's insistence that engineering problems come first and theory follows.

But Dadda's trajectory bent toward the digital. In 1953, he was offered a National Science Foundation scholarship to study at Caltech. He turned it down. Instead, he joined an initiative to build Italy's first digital computer. Under the Marshall Plan, the Politecnico secured funding for a state-of-the-art machine, and Dadda was sent to San Diego to collaborate with the Computer Research Corporation on the design of the CRC 102A. He worked on finalizing the computer and escorted it by ship to Italy in 1954, the machine packed carefully to protect its fragile vacuum tubes. It arrived in Milan to become the first working digital computer in Italy and, indeed, in continental Europe.

## Building a Computing Culture

At Politecnico, Dadda did not merely install the CRC 102A. He built an ecosystem around it. He trained students and faculty, organized Italy's first university courses in electronic data processing, and ran the Centro di Calcolo as a computing hub open to both academic research and industry. That openness was deliberate: Dadda saw computing as infrastructure for the economy, not a curiosity for specialists.

The CRC 102A lacked hardware for certain arithmetic operations. Dadda designed and built a floating-point arithmetic unit for it, effectively doubling its computing power. This was not a workaround; it was the beginning of a lifelong engagement with computer arithmetic.

By the late 1950s, Dadda had been instrumental in creating a new degree program in Electronic Engineering at Politecnico. He is widely regarded as Italy's first computer engineer and one of its first computer architects.

## The Dadda Multiplier

In 1965, Dadda proposed an optimized scheme for high-speed parallel binary multiplication. The design featured a reduced-height tree of partial-sum adders to minimize the addition stages needed, improving both performance and cost-efficiency of arithmetic logic units. The Dadda multiplier, as it came to be known, remains a reference design for efficient hardware multipliers.

The impact was extraordinary. Decades later, the IEEE recognized the Dadda multiplier as a Milestone achievement in electrical engineering. The only prior Italian recipients of an IEEE Milestone were Alessandro Volta, Guglielmo Marconi, and Enrico Fermi. That is the company Luigi Dadda keeps.

His work in computer arithmetic continued throughout his career. He introduced new architectures for fast convolution in signal processing, developed specialized arithmetic units for the FERMI particle accelerator project at CERN, and worked on cryptographic applications. Even in his later years, he contributed to research on decimal arithmetic units.

## Beyond Arithmetic

Dadda's research interests were broader than hardware. He explored Petri nets as a tool for designing complex control systems, an early foray into systems modeling and concurrent system design. Under his direction, Politecnico's computer labs conducted studies on programming languages, database systems, and computer networks.

## Leadership

Dadda became a full professor in 1960 and was appointed to the Chair of Electrical Engineering at Politecnico in 1962. He served as Rector of Politecnico di Milano from 1972 to 1984, a twelve-year tenure during which he oversaw modernization and strengthened ties between the university and both Italian industry and international research institutions.

In 1961, he co-founded the Associazione Italiana per l'Informatica e il Calcolo Automatico (AICA), Italy's first professional computer science society, serving as its president from 1967 to 1970. He co-founded and edited *Rivista di Informatica*, one of Italy's first computer science journals. He spearheaded the proposal for a European Informatics Network, realized in the late 1970s as project COST 11 under the European Economic Community, linking computing centers across Europe.

From 1980 to 1982, he chaired the Science and Technology Committee of the Italian Prime Minister, advising on national research and technology strategy. He served as a technical committee member and Board advisor for CSELT, the R&D arm of Telecom Italia. Even after formally retiring from Politecnico in 1998, he played a key role in establishing the Universita della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, and from 2000 until 2012 served as President of its Advanced Learning and Research Institute.

## Legacy

Dadda was named a Fellow of the IEEE and later elevated to Life Fellow in recognition of his contributions to computer arithmetic and digital signal processing architectures. He received the title of Cavaliere di Gran Croce dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana in 1976.

Among his students was [Domenico Ferrari](/blog/2026-02-14-domenico-ferrari), who went on to become a professor at UC Berkeley, a Fellow of both the ACM and the IEEE, and a leading figure in computer networks and operating systems. Through Ferrari and other students, Dadda's influence extended across the Atlantic and into new generations of computer scientists. The academic line runs from Bottani to Dadda, from Dadda to Ferrari, from Ferrari to my own advisor, and from my advisor to me.

Luigi Dadda passed away in Milan on October 26, 2012, at the age of eighty-nine. He left behind a field he had helped invent, an institution he had led for over a decade, and a legacy measured not only in circuits and algorithms but in the people he trained and the culture of engineering he built.
