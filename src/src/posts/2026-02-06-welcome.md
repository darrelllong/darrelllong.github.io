Welcome to my new blog. I'll be sharing thoughts on research, storage systems, security, and whatever else catches my attention in the world of computer science.

After many years of academic publishing, it's nice to have a more informal outlet for ideas that don't quite fit into a conference paper or journal article. Expect posts on topics ranging from the theoretical to the practical, and occasionally the whimsical.

Stay tuned.
